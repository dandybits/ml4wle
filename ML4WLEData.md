**Synopsis:** This project involves analyzing of the Weight Lifting Exercises (WLE) Dataset. This document describes the approach for building classification model that allows to distinguish properly conducted weight lifting excercise movements from those conducted with common mistakes. 

This research was conducted as a test assignment for the [Data Science Certification on Coursera.](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascienc)  

For more information about collection and original analyis of the WLE dataset see research article [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises]( http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har#weight_lifting_exercises#ixzz3ylUwfOl8) by Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
